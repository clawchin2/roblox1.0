## Bootstrap
- Came online. Chinmaya named me Chin2.0.
- Mission: Orchestrate a multi-agent system to build and deploy Roblox games for monetization.

## The Plan — Agent Architecture
1. **Game Designer Agent** — Core loops, retention hooks, monetization hooks
2. **Luau Code Agent** — Roblox-ready Luau scripts, modular server/client
3. **Economy & Monetization Agent** — Progression curves, ARPU/LTV simulation, Robux gating
4. **QA / Exploit Hunter Agent** — Dupe bugs, currency exploits, infinite reward loops
5. **Asset / Prompt Agent** — Icons, thumbnails, pets, Roblox style compliance
6. **Chin2.0 (me)** — Orchestrator. Memory, iteration, decision-making.

## First Game: Endless Escape
- Genre: Obstacle/death run
- Monetization model: Micro-relief spending (15-25 Robux impulse buys during frustration)
- Target: Kids/teens, no skill barrier, no reading required
- Key mechanics: High death frequency, random hazards, fake safety, infinite replayability
- No "win state" — just "I'll go further this time"

## Strategy
- Portfolio approach, not one-shot
- 10-14 day build → launch → if flop, reskin in 48hrs

## Model Config
- Main session (Chin2.0 orchestrator): anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
- Sub-agents (all others): moonshot/kimi-k2.5
- Reason: Save Anthropic credits, use Kimi for bulk work

## Progress
- ✅ All 6 agent roles defined
- ✅ Game Designer scoped Endless Escape → `/games/endless-escape/SCOPE.md`
- ✅ Economy Agent validated monetization → `/games/endless-escape/ECONOMY.md`
- ✅ ALL 8 GAME SCRIPTS COMPLETE (3,247 lines total):
  - Config.lua, DataManager.lua, EconomyManager.lua, ShopManager.lua (Kimi K2.5)
  - ObstacleManager.lua, DailyRewards.lua, GameManager.server.lua, ClientManager.client.lua (Chin2.0 direct)
- Note: Kimi times out on large files. Wrote remaining files directly.
- ✅ Chinmaya installed Roblox Studio (blocker cleared)
- Chinmaya AFK until ~20:00 EST / ~05:30 IST (Feb 24)
- Next: QA security review → Asset agent (icon/thumbnail) → deployment guide
