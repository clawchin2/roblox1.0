# Memory Log - 2026-02-27 - Creature Simulator Development

## Project Status End of Day

### Project Overview
**Game:** Creature Simulator (Pet Simulator X style)  
**Platform:** Roblox  
**Goal:** ₹5L/month revenue  
**Timeline:** 8 weeks  
**Repository:** https://github.com/clawchin2/roblox1.0

## Major Decisions Made Today

### 1. Pivot from Endless Runner to Creature Simulator
- **Reason:** Pet Simulator monetization is 10-50x better than endless runners
- **Reference:** Pet Simulator X, Adopt Me revenue models
- **User Approval:** Chinmaya approved the switch

### 2. Development Team Structure (4-Agent System)
Established continuous development loop:
- **Designer Agent** - Creates specs, gets user approval
- **Coder Agent** - Implements approved features  
- **Tester Agent** - Tests builds, finds bugs
- **QA Agent** - Verifies quality, approves/rejects

### 3. Expert Knowledge Base Created
Compiled comprehensive guide (`EXPERT_KNOWLEDGE.md`) covering:
- Pet following systems (BodyPosition + BodyGyro)
- Gacha mechanics and weighted random selection
- DataStore best practices
- Trading system architecture
- Monetization strategies (49/99/199 R$ pricing)
- Visual effects and TweenService animations

## Day 1 Development Summary

### Tasks Completed:
1. ✅ Core click-to-earn system (click platform → coins)
2. ✅ Coin display UI (top center)
3. ✅ Egg shop with 3 egg types (100/500/2000 coins)
4. ✅ Hatch system with 5 rarities (Common to Legendary)
5. ✅ 16 fantasy creatures defined
6. ✅ Hatch animation UI with rarity colors
7. ✅ Pet following player (BodyPosition physics)
8. ✅ Equipped pet display (top-right corner)

### Critical Bugs Fixed:
1. **Hatch UI not appearing** - Fixed RemoteEvent race condition
2. **Egg purchase not working** - Fixed HatchHandler to use _G.HatchEgg
3. **Two competing systems** - Consolidated to single GameManager hatch function

### Files Created/Modified:
- `EXPERT_KNOWLEDGE.md` - 11KB implementation guide
- `DEVELOPMENT_TRACKER.md` - Live progress tracking
- `GOAL_DAY1.md` - Day 1 feature specifications
- `GameManager.server.lua` - Core game logic
- `HatchHandler.server.lua` - Egg hatching server handler
- `PetFollow.server.lua` - Pet following system
- `HatchUI.client.lua` - Hatch animation UI
- `EquippedUI.client.lua` - Equipped pet display
- `UI.client.lua` - Main game UI

## Technical Learnings

### What Works:
- BodyPosition + BodyGyro for smooth pet following
- Singleton RemoteEvent pattern (create once, reuse)
- pcall() for all DataStore and hatch operations
- Weighted random selection for gacha rarities
- TweenService for UI animations

### What Failed:
- Initial endless runner approach (poor monetization)
- Multiple competing hatch systems (caused bugs)
- Recreating RemoteEvent each time (broke connections)
- Lack of input validation (caused errors)

### QA Process Issues:
- First QA pass missed critical egg purchase bug
- Implemented STRICT QA process with 10-test minimum
- Now require code review + gameplay testing + verification

---

## User Interactions

### Chinmaya's Feedback:
1. Initial endless runner had gap/spawn issues
2. Approved switch to Creature Simulator
3. Approved 8-week timeline to ₹5L/month
4. Requested Derek Laufman art style reference
5. Demanded perfect quality (multiple loops if needed)

### Outstanding Issues:
- Need to verify egg purchase works after final fix
- Waiting for strict tester verification
- Day 2 planning pending Day 1 approval

---

## Revenue Projection

### Target: ₹5L/month
**Required:** 10,000 DAU spending ₹50/month average

### Timeline Estimate:
- Week 1-2: Core loop (current) → ₹0
- Week 3-4: Social features → ₹10-30K
- Week 5-6: Monetization → ₹50K-1L
- Week 7-8: Launch → ₹1-2L
- Month 2-3: Scale → ₹5L

---

## Next Steps (Day 2)

### Pending Tasks:
1. Verify egg purchase works (critical)
2. Add pet inventory UI
3. Add trading system
4. Implement DataStore saving
5. Add sound effects
6. Add particle effects for rare pets

### Approval Needed:
- Day 2 goal proposal from Designer
- User approval before coding begins

---

## Agent Performance Notes

### What Worked:
- 4-agent system with clear roles
- EXPERT_KNOWLEDGE.md as shared reference
- GitHub integration for code sharing
- Continuous loop with user approval gates

### What Needs Improvement:
- QA initially missed critical bugs
- Coder created duplicate systems
- Need stricter testing requirements
- Better communication between agents

### Improvements Implemented:
- STRICT QA with 10-test minimum
- Code review requirements
- Singleton patterns enforced
- Error handling mandatory

### References Studied:
1. Roblox DevForum Pet System tutorials
2. Pet Simulator X game mechanics analysis
3. TweenService UI animation guides
4. DataStore best practices
5. Monetization strategy research

### YouTube Channels Noted:
