## 📊 REFERENCE: Pet Simulator X Framework

### Core Loops (What We Need):
1. **Earn → Hatch → Collect → Trade → Repeat**
2. **Social:** Show off rare pets to friends
3. **Progression:** Better pets = faster earning
4. **Events:** Limited time eggs create urgency
5. **Trading:** Economy between players

### Monetization Points:
1. Coin packs (immediate)
2. Gamepasses (convenience)
3. Limited eggs (FOMO)
4. Season pass (monthly)
5. Trading tax (small %)
